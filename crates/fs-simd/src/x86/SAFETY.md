# SAFETY: fs-simd/src/x86/mod.rs

## Invariants
`unsafe` is confined to (a) AVX2/AVX-512 load/store/arithmetic intrinsics on
pointers derived from `as_chunks::<4/8/16>()` fixed-size arrays over live slices
(exact lane extents, unaligned-safe `loadu`/`storeu` only), and
(b) calls to `#[target_feature]` functions. Tails are handled by the scalar
twin; no partial-lane access exists.

## Aliasing assumptions
`&[f64]` in, `&mut [f64]` out; borrow rules preclude mutable aliasing. The
only read-modify-write is `axpy`'s exclusively-borrowed chunk.

## Alignment assumptions
None: only unaligned load/store intrinsics are used. Upstream 128-byte
alignment is performance, not soundness.

## Lifetime assumptions
No pointer outlives the loop iteration deriving it.

## Panic behavior
Length asserts fire before any unsafe block. No unwinding between a load and
its paired store.

## Cancellation behavior
Bounded, allocation-free loops; no poll points (callers chunk work at tile
granularity per the fs-exec discipline).

## Concurrency behavior
No shared state, no atomics; Send/Sync are the slices' properties.

## Miri coverage
Miri cannot interpret x86 vector intrinsics; under `cfg(miri)` dispatch
routes to the scalar twin. Compensating checks: the tier-equivalence battery
runs natively on x86-64 hardware (trj machine + CI runner).

## Model-checking coverage
N/A (no concurrency).

## Fuzz/property coverage
`tier_equivalence_battery` (shared with NEON): seeded inputs, special
values, every tail length 0..67; elementwise bitwise vs twin, reductions
within the documented envelope.

## Proof obligations discharged by callers
None. Public façades re-verify CPU features via
`is_x86_feature_detected!` before every `#[target_feature]` call and fall back
to the scalar twin otherwise. Dense GEMM's process-wide table is the sole
one-shot exception: `x86::gemm::select_mk8x4_f64` verifies AVX2+FMA and only
then returns the private unchecked thunk. That thunk cannot be named outside
the `x86::gemm` module, so module privacy carries the feature proof from
selection to the installed safe function pointer.

## mk8x4_f64 (bead xlvx)

The 8×4 GEMM microkernel façade checks `kc·8` and `kc·4` for `usize`
overflow and asserts panel bounds BEFORE the unsafe body; the AVX2+FMA body reads
exactly 4 f64 per `loadu` at offsets `kk·4 ≤ kc·4 − 4` (B) and
broadcasts single elements at `kk·8 + r ≤ kc·8 − 1` (A); every
`storeu` writes 4 f64 into a row of the caller's `[[f64; 4]; 8]`.
Feature availability (AVX2+FMA) is runtime-verified either immediately by the
public façade or once by the table-owned selector. The unchecked thunk remains
private to `x86::gemm`; safe crate code cannot call it directly. Compensating
check: the tier-equivalence battery gates bitwise equality with the scalar twin over kc ∈ 0..17 ∪
{256} including special values and nonzero starting accumulators.

## r4qrun_f64 (bead 27d3, file x86/fft.rs)

Radix-4 Stockham q-run butterfly, AVX2+FMA twin of `scalar::r4qrun_f64`.
The façade `r4qrun_f64` validates all slice geometry, then re-verifies
avx2+fma before entering the `#[target_feature]` body and delegates to the
scalar twin otherwise, so it is unconditionally safe to call. Bounds: the body processes four
complex elements (8 f64) per iteration at offset `o = 8·q8` with
`o + 8 ≤ s2` (loop bound `q8 < s2/8`, and `s2 % 8 == 0` is checked — runs
that are not a multiple of 8 f64 delegate WHOLE to the twin in safe
code); each `loadu` reads exactly 4 f64 at `o` (resp. `o + 4`), each
`storeu` writes exactly 4 f64 at a disjoint output-row offset
`j·s2 + o` (resp. `+ 4`) within `out` (checked `4·s2` length, asserted). Only
unaligned `loadu`/`storeu` are used (no alignment precondition).
Deinterleave/interleave use `unpacklo/hi_pd` + `permute4x64_pd` (pure
data movement); the arithmetic is the twin's exact per-element
composition — fused real part via `_mm256_fmadd_pd`, the separate
`im·w` product via `_mm256_mul_pd`, `-(…)` via a sign-bit `xor` (bit-
identical to Rust unary `-`). Compensating check: `tier_equivalence_
battery` gates bitwise equality with the scalar twin over run lengths
{2,6,8,32,34} (covering both the vector path and the whole-delegation
tail), both directions, special values — verified GREEN natively on
x86-64 (Threadripper 5995WX). fs-fft's golden hash is tier-invariant.

## btile4x4p_f64 (bead 9ekv, file x86/gemm.rs)

Packed 4×4 batched-GEMM tile microkernel, AVX2+FMA twin of
`scalar::btile4x4p_f64`. The façade validates all slice geometry, then
re-verifies avx2+fma before the `#[target_feature]` body and delegates to the
scalar twin otherwise, so it is unconditionally safe to call. Bounds are asserted up front by the
shared `checked_btile4x4p_lengths` (the same helper the scalar/NEON
twins use): `a_len ≤ a.len()`, `b_len ≤ b.len()`, `dst_len ≤ dst.len()`.
The vector body derives four A row-bases `((i0+t)·k)·mb` and four B
col-bases `((j0+t)·k)·mb`; per lane-block `m` (step 4, `m < (mb/4)·4`)
and per `l ∈ 0..k` it reads exactly 4 f64 at `base(t) + l·mb + m`
(maximal offset `≤ base + (k−1)·mb + mb − 4`, inside the extents) and
writes exactly 4 f64 per output row at `(ti·4+tj)·mb + m` (16 disjoint
rows within `dst`). Every lane block derives fresh cursors from the validated
bases and advances them only when another `l` load remains; the final step
therefore never forms a transient pointer beyond the allocation's one-past
boundary. The `mb % 4` tail lanes run the scalar per-lane
loop over the same bounded pointers. Only unaligned `loadu`/`storeu`
are used. Bitwise contract: 16 `__m256d` accumulators start at
`_mm256_setzero_pd()` (+0.0) and fuse via `_mm256_fmadd_pd` in
l-ascending order — exactly the twin's per-lane `mul_add` from +0.0.
Compensating check: `tier_equivalence_battery` gates bitwise equality
with the scalar twin over the tested (k, mb) grid.
