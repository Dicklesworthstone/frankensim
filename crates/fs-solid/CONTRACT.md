# fs-solid CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

Layer: L3 (FLUX). The elasticity core (plan §8.2, bead tfz.13):
small-strain elasticity through finite-strain hyperelasticity, with a
MEASURED locking-free formulation, on both the body-fitted and the
CutFEM-on-SDF frontends. Constitutive laws live in fs-material; this
crate owns kinematics, weak forms, boundary operators, and the
globalized Newton loop.

## Public types and semantics

- `Mesh2` / `Patch`: structured body-fitted meshes — P1 triangles, Q1
  quads, mapped Q1 panels (`cooks_membrane`), with the four sides as
  named patches. `shapes_at`/`quad_points` expose the isoparametric
  machinery (chain rule with the transposed inverse Jacobian — the
  conformance battery pinned this exact slip on triangles and mapped
  panels).
- `LinearProblem` (plane strain/stress via `PlaneKind`, `lame`):
  small-strain elasticity with strong Dirichlet and dead-load traction
  patches; `Formulation::Standard` vs `Formulation::BBar` (Hughes'
  dilatation projection — element-average volumetric gradient,
  equivalent to condensed constant-pressure mixed elements).
- `HyperProblem` + `NewtonSettings`/`NewtonReport`: plane-strain
  finite strain; the 2D displacement gradient embeds into the 3D
  deformation gradient (F₃₃ = 1); residual `∫ P : ∇δu` and consistent
  tangent `∫ ∇δu : A : ∇Δu` come from fs-material's exact AD Piola
  stress and 9×9 tangent. Newton globalizes by Armijo backtracking on
  the potential energy (material refusals — det F ≤ 0 — halve the
  step) under linear load stepping; systems solve with MINRES
  (symmetric, indefinite-safe near buckling). `residual_and_tangent` /
  `potential_energy` are the public consistency probes.
- `CutElasticity`/`CutSolution`: vector Q1 linear elasticity on
  fs-cutfem background quadtrees — certified classification and cut
  quadrature reused verbatim; VECTOR symmetric Nitsche (full traction
  consistency `σ(N_a e_i)·n`, penalty β(λ+2μ)/h tied to certified cut
  cells); componentwise ghost penalty γ(λ+2μ)h.
- `select_formulation(RegimeIndicators)`: the documented
  element-selection policy — B-bar when ν ≥ 0.45 or slenderness ≥ 5
  (fs-regime's indicators feed this; the locking battery measures the
  boundary).
- `stability` (bead tfz.15): `reduced_pencil` (free-DOF K and
  geometric stiffness K_G(σ₀) from the linear prebuckling state),
  `buckling_loads` — the pencil `(K + λK_G)φ = 0` solved MATRIX-FREE
  by fs-la LOBPCG on the Cholesky-reduced operator L⁻¹(−K_G)L⁻ᵀ
  (dense reduction fixture-gated at n ≤ 4096), modes −K_G-normalized;
  `lambda_indicator` (Richardson) + `evidence_row`;
  `eigenvalue_derivative` (direct pencil derivative at frozen
  prebuckling stress), `group_stiffness` (per-group Young's-scale
  lever), and the clustered-eigenvalue policy: `ks_aggregate` /
  `ks_aggregate_derivative` — the conservative smooth KS lower
  envelope with softmax-weighted derivatives, because individual
  eigenvalues are not differentiable where branches cross (measured
  in the battery).
- `continuation` (bead tfz.15): `PathResidual` (generic equilibrium
  residual R(u,λ) = R_int − λF_ext; `HyperProblem` implements it for
  homogeneous clamps + ramped dead tractions), `advance` — Keller
  bordered pseudo-arclength with MINRES/dense-LU tangent solves
  (indefinite-safe through limit points), step halving/growth,
  limit-point events (λ̇ sign flips) and branch-point candidates
  (Cholesky definiteness flips without a λ̇ flip, gated n ≤ 1024);
  `PathState` — the checkpointable trajectory (clone to checkpoint,
  hand back to resume; split runs are BITWISE identical to straight
  runs); `switch_branch` — null-direction predictor pinning
  (`pending_switch`): the arc constraint forces the first step along
  the buckling mode so the corrector lands on the bifurcated branch
  (a state-only perturbation relaxes back to the fundamental branch;
  a basin-scale jump inverts elements — both measured failure modes).
- `rod` (bead tfz.14): geometrically exact Cosserat rods — nodal
  positions + unit quaternions updated MULTIPLICATIVELY through
  fs-time's exponential map; strains Γ = Rᵀr′ − e₁ and
  κ = 2log(qᵢ⁻¹qᵢ₊₁)/L₀ from RELATIVE quantities (rigid motions give
  exactly zero strain — energy-invariance battery). Statics: FD
  residual/tangent Newton with residual backtracking and load
  stepping, fixture-gated; fixture slenderness matters — a
  penalty-stiff EA puts a quadratic spurious-stretch wall around
  every Newton iterate (measured, documented in the battery).
  Analytic tangents and SE(3) DYNAMICS under fs-time symplectic
  integrators are recorded successor scope.
- `fiber` (bead tfz.14): fiber sections over fs-material `Uniaxial`
  cards (Menegotto–Pinto steel; Mander concrete with the
  compression-positive convention flipped at the section boundary);
  `respond`/`commit` split (pure response vs state commitment);
  `update_sections_batched` — the §15.2 hot loop through fs-la's
  batched Cholesky with a per-outlier direct fallback, throughput
  measured and ledgered; `rc_section` fixture (confined core +
  unconfined cover + steel layers).
- `beamcol` (bead tfz.14): force-based (Spacone) cantilever element —
  EXACT equilibrium interpolation, five-point Gauss–Lobatto section
  integration (a point AT the hinge), per-section Newton with
  residual backtracking, virtual-work tip deflection; pushover and
  cyclic histories with committed, cloneable state (G4).
- `koiter` [F], feature `koiter-asymptotics` (off by default): FD
  energy expansion along the buckling mode at the critical state →
  a/b coefficients and `Bifurcation` classification, with the
  SAMPLED-CONTINUATION fallback oracle (the imperfect-geometry path)
  cross-checking imperfection tolerance.
- `accept_scenario_bc`: fs-scenario integration — `Dirichlet` and
  `Traction` under `Physics::Elasticity` accepted; dimensioned-value
  resolution stays with the scenario consumer.

## Invariants

1. Patch tests exact: linear displacement fields are reproduced to
   solver tolerance on P1, Q1, B-bar, and the CutFEM frontend
   (all-embedded fixture) — sol-001.
2. MMS optimal orders per implemented family × frontend: L2 ≈ 2,
   H1 ≈ 1 for P1/Q1/CutFEM-Q1 (sol-002).
3. Objectivity through the fs-material interface: W(RF) = W(F) and
   P(RF) = R·P(F) for both cards (sol-003).
4. Consistency merge gate: the assembled tangent equals the FD
   directional derivative of the residual, and the residual is the
   exact gradient of the potential energy (rel ≤ 1e-6) — sol-004.
5. Locking is MEASURED, not assumed: on thin near-incompressible
   bending, the standard element's error degrades by ≥10× from
   ν = 0.3 to ν = 0.4999 while B-bar stays within 2× (sol-005).
6. Cook's membrane envelope: converged tip at the literature reference
   point (48, 52) inside [23.5, 24.5] (plane stress, ν = 1/3), ≤2%
   self-convergence deviation; near-incompressible B-bar
   self-converges while the standard element's shortfall is logged
   (sol-006).
7. Newton robustness: large-strain bending and a buckling-adjacent
   compressed strip converge under load stepping + line search with
   fast terminal contraction; histories and backtracks are evidence
   (sol-007).
8. Determinism: BTree/insertion-ordered assembly, deterministic
   Krylov solvers; bit-identical across runs on a platform —
   including continuation trajectories (checkpoint/resume proven
   bitwise-equal in stab-002).
9. Buckling: the Euler strut's EXTRAPOLATED critical load lands
   within 3% of the analytic value with the Richardson indicator
   covering the raw fine-mesh gap (Q1 parasitic-shear inflation,
   reported, stab-001); pencil symmetry to 1e-10 and mode
   K-orthogonality to 1e-6.
10. Continuation: validated against the CLOSED-FORM von Mises truss
    (limit points within 5–10% of analytic, manifold deviation
    ≤ 1e-7, load control jumps where arclength traces, stab-002);
    the continuum tent traces the full snap-through Z-curve on one
    path — snap and snap-back limit points, load recovery beyond the
    load-control failure point (stab-003).
11. Branch handling: bifurcation detected within 15% of the pencil
    prediction on the compressed column; null-direction switching
    lands on the bent branch (transverse growth ≥ 20× measured,
    stab-004).

## Error model

`SolidError` teaching errors: `SolveFailed` (linear gate missed),
`NewtonStalled` (carries the residual history; repair = more load
steps), `MaterialRefused` (det F ≤ 0 escaped globalization; repair =
smaller steps), `UnknownPatch`, `UnsupportedBc` (fs-scenario mapping
outside Dirichlet/Traction × Elasticity).

## Determinism class

Bit-deterministic across runs on a fixed platform (ordered assembly,
fs-solver CG/MINRES, no threading, no ambient state). Cross-ISA
golden hashes are not yet recorded (follow-up).

## Cancellation behavior

Bounded synchronous loops (assembly, capped Krylov iterations, capped
Newton with capped backtracking). Chunked Cx polling belongs to the
fs-exec driver (the L3 discipline; fs-feec/fs-cutfem precedent).

## Unsafe boundary

`#![deny(unsafe_code)]` via workspace lints; no capsules.

## Feature flags

`koiter-asymptotics` (off by default): the plan-flagged [F] Koiter
post-buckling module and its battery, per the Ambition-Tag gating
rule. No other flags.

### Structural invariants (tfz.14)

12. Rod objectivity: superposed rigid motion leaves strain energy
    invariant to 1e-12 (str-001).
13. Elastica: large-deflection tip matches an in-test SHOOTING oracle
    (RK4 + bisection on the elastica BVP) within 0.015·L at
    PL²/EI = 2 (str-002).
14. Helical family: pure bending gives the EI/M circle (2%), pure
    torsion stays straight (1e-6) at rate M/GJ (2%), combined moments
    give the constant helix strain state (3%) — str-003.
15. RC hysteresis: per-cycle dissipation positive and growing with
    amplitude, peak moment inside the hand capacity band, section
    states bitwise-deterministic across runs (str-004).
16. Batched section updates are scalar-consistent to 1e-8 with
    ledgered throughput (str-005).
17. Force-based pushover softens past yield (secant < 0.5× initial),
    dissipates under reversal, and resumes from a checkpoint
    BITWISE (G4) — str-006.

## Conformance tests

`tests/battery.rs`: sol-001 patch tests (body-fitted max nodal error
≤ 1e-9; CutFEM at the CG-tolerance floor ≤ 1e-7); sol-002 MMS orders
(P1 2.00/1.00, Q1 2.00/1.00, CutFEM 2.19/1.04); sol-003 objectivity
(energy rel ≤ 1e-10, stress rotation ≤ 1e-8, 8 random states × 2
cards); sol-004 tangent/energy consistency (≤ 1e-6); sol-005 locking
battery (standard degrades ≥10×, B-bar ≤2×); sol-006 Cook's envelope;
sol-007 Newton robustness (5-step large bending, 8-step compression,
terminal contraction ≥ 100×); the selection-policy probe. Unit tests:
mapped-mesh areas, selection thresholds.

`tests/stability.rs` (bead tfz.15): stab-001 Euler pencil (analytic
G2 + Richardson indicator); stab-002 von Mises truss closed-form
continuation oracle (+ bitwise resume); stab-003 continuum tent
snap-through with the self-calibrating load-control-failure probe;
stab-004 branch detection + null-direction switching; stab-005
eigenvalue-derivative gradient gate (rel ≤ 1e-3 vs frozen-K_G FD) and
the clustered-eigenvalue trap (min() kink ≈ 2 measured, KS aggregate
smooth with derivative matching FD to 1e-6, conservative).
`tests/koiter.rs` (feature-gated): stab-006 symmetric-stable
classification + imperfect-geometry sampled oracle.

`tests/structural.rs` (bead tfz.14): str-001 objectivity; str-002
elastica vs shooting oracle; str-003 circle/twist/helix; str-004 RC

consistency + throughput ledger; str-006 force-based pushover,
reversal dissipation, G4 bitwise resume.

## No-claim boundaries

- TDNNS-proper / weakly-imposed-symmetry FEEC stress elements: awaits
  the simplicial H(curl)/H(div) family bead (dcng); B-bar is the
  shipped, measured locking-free path with the same acceptance metric.
- 3D and shells; higher-order families (Qk/Pk, k ≥ 2); IGA frontend
  (bead tfz.9).
- Hyperelasticity on the CutFEM frontend (linear ships there; the
  finite-strain cut path composes this crate's Newton loop with
  fs-cutfem quadrature in a successor bead).
- fs-opdsl-generated residual/adjoint paths (the DSL coverage bead);
  the hand path here passes the same consistency gates the DSL output
  must pass.
- Contact, plasticity flow (fs-material's plastic module wires in a
  successor), dynamics/time integration.
- Ogden energies (fs-material's recorded no-claim propagates).
- Rod SE(3) DYNAMICS (fs-time symplectic wiring) and analytic rod
  tangents; 3D frames/lattices assembled from rods (topo-truss's
  consumer pass); J2 continuum element wiring (the fs-material card
  ships with algorithmic moduli; the element battery is successor
  scope); published El Centro fiber-model plot digitization (the
  shipped envelope is the capacity band + self-consistency).
- fs-scenario dimensioned-value resolution (units plumbing stays with
  the scenario consumer; kind/physics validation ships here).
- Production-scale pencil solves (shift-invert/sparse factorizations
  beyond the fixture-gated dense reduction) and the
  prebuckling-adjoint chain dλ/ds through σ₀(s) (fs-ad/ASCENT
  integration successor); LOBPCG preconditioning hooks.
- Plate/shell buckling references (needs bending elements — the
  shells bead); the 2D canonical here is the strut.
- Koiter coefficients versus LITERATURE tables (v1 validates
  classification + the sampled oracle; quantitative a/b benchmarking
  awaits the shell fixtures where the classic tables live).
