# fs-material — CONTRACT

The constitutive-law kernel (plan patch Rev E): materials as mathematical
objects — calibration domains, CONSISTENT tangent operators, thermodynamic
guardrails, hysteresis, uncertainty — owned in one crate so structural
claims stay credible.

Ambition tags: elastic/hyperelastic/J2/RC-fiber laws + calibration [S];
Ogden staged [F, no-claim below].

## Purpose and layer

Layer **L3** (FLUX support). Runtime deps: `std`, fs-ad (dual-number
energy derivatives), fs-evidence (model cards, Evidence), fs-qty, fs-math.
Consumers: fs-solid elasticity (tfz.13), fiber-section beams, lattice
homogenization, the P2 milestone.

## Public types and semantics

- `SmallStrainLaw` trait (Voigt 6-space, TENSOR shear components):
  `stress` / `tangent` / `update_state` / `admissibility` / `card`.
  **The tangent contract**: `tangent` is the exact derivative of the
  ALGORITHMIC stress update at the same committed state — FD-gated for
  every law in conformance (merge-gate discipline, same as adjoints).
- `IsotropicElastic` (E, ν → Lamé), `OrthotropicElastic` (engineering
  constants; construction REFUSES thermodynamically inadmissible Poisson
  sets via compliance positive-definiteness minors).
- `J2Plasticity`: radial-return mapping with linear isotropic hardening
  and the Simo–Hughes algorithmic moduli
  `C = κ I⊗I + 2μθ I_dev − 2μθ̄ n̂⊗n̂`.
- `Hyperelastic` (`NeoHookean`, `MooneyRivlin`): stored energies written
  ONCE generic over the fs-ad `Real` scalar; `piola` is the exact dual
  gradient, `tangent` the exact nested-dual Hessian (9×9). `det F ≤ 0`
  refuses structurally.
- `Uniaxial` trait + the RC flagship pair: `MenegottoPintoSteel`
  (R0/a1/a2 curvature degradation, Bauschinger via branch-state
  asymptote intersection) and `ManderConcrete` (confined envelope
  `f = f′cc·x·r/(r−1+xʳ)`, elastic unload/reload lines with residual
  strain, zero tension).
- `calibrate_bilinear`: segmented least squares recovering (E, σ_y, H)
  from monotonic data with standard-error envelopes and RMS residual.
- `evidence_stress`: wraps any law's stress in `Evidence` with the card
  attached and `in_domain` FLAGGING calibration-domain exit.
- `tensor`: Voigt helpers (deviator, contraction with shear doubling,
  von Mises, Rodrigues rotations) used by the objectivity gates.

## Invariants

1. **Tangent consistency (the merge gate)**: every law's tangent matches
   central FD of its own stress to ≤1e−5 relative across elastic branch,
   plastic branch, cyclic states, and 9×9 hyperelastic components.
2. **Frame indifference**: isotropic small-strain σ(QεQᵀ) = Qσ(ε)Qᵀ;
   hyperelastic P(QF) = Q·P(F) — randomized rotation battery.
3. **Return-map consistency**: after every J2 update, the yield function
   at the returned stress satisfies f ≤ tolerance; dissipation increments
   σ:Δεₚ ≥ 0 (associative flow), total cycle dissipation > 0.
4. **Hysteresis fixture behavior**: M-P virgin curve approaches the b·E₀
   asymptote, tangents E₀/b·E₀ at the extremes, reverse branches soften
   below the elastic line (Bauschinger), symmetric cycles dissipate;
   Mander peaks exactly at (ε_cc, f′cc) with slope 0, softens post-peak,
   unloads to the residual strain, reloads rejoining the envelope.
5. **Calibration round-trip**: synthetic bilinear data recovers E within
   1%, H within 5%, σ_y within 2%, truth inside the fitted envelope.
6. **Inadmissible parameters refuse at construction** (ν bounds,
   compliance definiteness, Ec > Esec, b ∈ [0,1), positive yield).

## Error model

`MaterialError`: `Parameters`, `State` (e.g. det F ≤ 0), `Calibration`.
Out-of-calibration-domain USE is not an error — it is flagged through
`Evidence.model.in_domain` so upstream policy decides.

## Determinism class

**D0**: pure f64 arithmetic with fs_math::det transcendentals; no
iteration counts depend on ambient state (radial return is closed-form).

## Cancellation behavior

All updates are closed-form, allocation-free; P7 by boundedness.

## Unsafe boundary

Zero `unsafe`.

## Feature flags

None.

## Conformance tests

`tests/conformance.rs` (JSON verdicts, suite `fs-material/conformance`):
mt-001 FD tangent gate (every law, cyclic states); mt-002 objectivity;
mt-003 return-map consistency + dissipation; mt-004 hysteresis fixtures;
mt-005 calibration round-trip (+ degenerate refusals); mt-006 rank-one
convexity sampling for NH/MR, constructor refusals, card completeness,
Evidence domain flagging.

## No-claim boundaries

- **Ogden is staged, not shipped**: its principal-stretch energy needs
  eigenvalue derivatives, which need `acos`/`atan` on the fs-ad `Real`
  trait (upstream extension). Tracked for the fs-ad owner; until then
  NH/MR are the hyperelastic set.
- **Mander cyclic rules are the simplified elastic-unload variant**
  (declared on the card): no cyclic stiffness degradation beyond the
  residual-strain rule, no tension stiffening. Full Mander cyclic rules
  are follow-up work for the fiber-beam bead.
- **J2 has no Bauschinger effect** (isotropic hardening only; kinematic/
  mixed hardening is a follow-up law, the card says so).
- **No damage/softening 3D laws yet**; failure envelopes are declarative.
- **Rank-one convexity is SAMPLED**, a necessary-condition spot test —
  not a polyconvexity proof (interval-certified convexity belongs to the
  certifier tier).
- **Calibration v0 is bilinear segmented LSQ**; nonlinear (Mander/M-P
  parameter) fitting and posterior envelopes land with fs-io CSV
  catalogs and the UQ stack.
- **Homogenization hooks**: homogenized laws register as ordinary
  `ModelCard`-carrying laws; the unit-cell pipeline itself is the
  lattice bead's scope.
