# fs-time CONTRACT

## Purpose and layer

Layer: **L3 FLUX** (deps: fs-ad, fs-blake3, fs-exec, fs-ga, fs-la,
fs-math, and the shared fs-solver operator/Newton-Krylov spine — all downward
or same-layer services).
Structure-preserving time integration (plan §8.5): integrators that
preserve what the physics preserves — symplectic (Störmer–Verlet with
its discrete-Lagrangian equivalence tested), Lie-group SO(3) via
exponential-map updates and SE(3) on fs-ga PGA motors (exp-map lane
plus a free-body discrete Euler–Poincaré variational lane),
generalized-α with controllable dissipation, IMEX and exponential
integrators for stiffness, and embedded-pair adaptivity with a PI
controller. The two universal obligations (P7 + §8.7) — resumable
state machines and discrete adjoints of the stepper — are discharged
where claimed below.

## Public types and semantics

- `symplectic::verlet_step(q, p, h, force, scratch)` — one
  kick–drift–kick step for separable H = ½‖p‖² + V(q), unit mass
  (scale q/p externally otherwise). `force` writes F(q) = −∇V.
- `symplectic::verlet_adjoint(q0, p0, h, steps, force, force_jvp,
  (bar_q_N, bar_p_N)) -> (bar_q0, bar_p0)` — discrete adjoint OF THE
  STEPPER (transposed tangent map, reverse order), propagated with
  `fs_ad::revolve` checkpointing (O(log N) memory).
  **Precondition: symmetric ∂F/∂q** (conservative forces): the reverse
  pass evaluates Jᵀv through the user's `force_jvp` as Jᵀv = Jv.
- `lie::{quat_mul, quat_exp, quat_exp_step, quat_rotate}` — (w, x, y, z)
  unit quaternions; `quat_exp` uses a series branch below θ = 1e−6 (no
  sinc cancellation). `lie::rigid_body_step(q, ω, I, h)` — torque-free
  Euler equations via midpoint RK2 + CG2 exp-map attitude update at the
  midpoint ω; returns (q′, ω′).
- `galpha::GeneralizedAlpha::new(m, c, k, n, h, rho_inf)` +
  `galpha_step(ga, q, v, a, f_next)` — Chung–Hulbert: αm = (2ρ−1)/(ρ+1),
  αf = ρ/(ρ+1), γ = ½ − αm + αf, β = ¼(1 − αm + αf)²; one prefactored
  LU of the effective matrix per (M, C, K, h); `f_next` is the load at
  t + (1−αf)h. Newmark correctors update (q, v, a) in place.
- `galpha::{SecondOrderProblem, LinearSecondOrderSystem}` describe
  `M a + C v + r(q) = f`; the linear adapter binds the exact shared
  `fs_solver::LinearOp` interface for M/C/K, while nonlinear problems provide
  matched internal-force and tangent actions. `OperatorGeneralizedAlpha`
  solves the same Chung–Hulbert residual through `NewtonKrylovState` and
  commits a `SecondOrderState` only after convergence.
- `galpha::FirstOrderGeneralizedAlpha` + `first_order_galpha_step` are the
  prefactored small-system lane for `M udot + A u = f`.
  `OperatorFirstOrderGeneralizedAlpha` consumes `FirstOrderProblem` (or the
  `LinearFirstOrderSystem` adapter) and uses the first-order-system
  Jansen–Whiting–Hulbert parameters αm = (3−ρ)/(2(1+ρ)), αf = 1/(1+ρ),
  γ = 1/2 + αm − αf. This is not the structural second-order formulation
  relabeled: state and rate are first-class and the residual is enforced at
  `(t_n + αf h, u_n + αf (u_{n+1}−u_n))`.
- `galpha::{ImplicitSolveConfig, ImplicitStepTelemetry}` retain the full
  Newton report per accepted step, including outer residual decisions and
  inner Krylov counts. `SecondOrderState` and `FirstOrderState` retain time,
  solution/rate variables, accepted-step count, and complete telemetry as
  cloneable plain data.
- `stiff::Imex2::new(l, n, h)` + `imex2_step` — ARS(2,2,2),
  γ = 1 − 1/√2, diagonally implicit on L (one LU reused for both
  stages), explicit N, stiffly accurate, R(∞) = 0. Second order in
  BOTH parts: the explicit weights are (δ, 1−δ) with δ = 1 − 1/(2γ);
  trapezoidal (½, ½) is only first order in N (caught during
  construction, locked by the convergence test).
- `stiff::OperatorImex2` applies that identical ARS(2,2,2) tableau to any
  `LinearOp`. Each `(I − γhL)` stage uses FGMRES with an injected
  `FlexiblePreconditioner`; both true-residual reports are recorded in
  `ImexStepTelemetry`, and `ImexState` changes only if both stages converge.
  `IdentityPreconditioner` is the explicit unpreconditioned fixture lane, not
  the field-scale recommendation.
- `stiff::ExpEuler::new(a, n, h)` + `.step(u, nonlin)` — exponential
  Euler for u′ = Au + N(u), **symmetric A** via the fs-la Jacobi
  eigenbasis; φ₁(x) = expm1(x)/x (cancellation-free). Exact for N ≡ 0.
- `adaptive::{AdaptiveState, PiController, rk45_adaptive}` —
  Dormand–Prince 5(4), max-norm error against atol + rtol·|u|, PI
  update h ← h·safety·err^{−0.14}·err_prev^{0.08} clamped to
  [0.2, 5.0]; rejections shrink with the classical −1/5 exponent.
- `se3` module (bead 3ol0): `Twist` (body ω then v);
  `se3_exp_step(M, twist, h)` — `M ← M ∘ exp(−(h/2)·B(ω, v))` through
  fs-ga's screw exponential, returning the CANONICAL double-cover
  representative (`canonicalize_motor`: first nonzero even component
  in `EVEN_BLADES` order made positive; `M` and `−M` canonicalize
  bit-identically; all-zero refuses). `se3_exp_step_renorm` adds
  drift-controlled versor renormalization gated by `RenormPolicy` and
  returns a `RenormReceipt` (defect before, whether renormalized,
  reported drift) — drift is ledger fodder, never silently absorbed.
  `se3_rigid_body_step` — free-body Euler equations + body transport
  of the spatially constant velocity, midpoint RK2 in the algebra with
  one exp update at the midpoint twist. `dep_free_step` — discrete
  Euler–Poincaré free-body step in body-momentum form (fixed-point
  solve controlled by `DepSolveParams`, per-step `DepStepReceipt`);
  spatial angular momentum is conserved EXACTLY by construction.
  `run_dep_free` returns a `BalanceReceipt` whose `Se3ClaimClass` is
  decided by `claim_for(declaration, all_solves_converged)`: the
  conservative variational theorem class only for declared smooth,
  conservative, regular-constraint, fixed-step fixtures with every
  solve converged — dissipation, adaptivity, or divergence demote to
  `MeasuredOnly` with measured drift receipts. `dep_momentum_adjoint`
  pulls a terminal cotangent through the transposed implicit-function
  tangent of each step's ACTUAL residual. `RattleProjection` is the
  constraint hook fs-mbd's constrained lanes plug into
  (`Unconstrained` is the trivial impl).

- `slabs` module (addendum Proposal 4, bead bk0o.7; [F], behind
  `time-slabs`): time slabs as CELLS. `SlabEntry` carries the TEMPORAL
  COCYCLE — the split step's defect against the monolithic residual
  over the slab — and `SlabLedger::attribute` is the budget pie
  pointed at time ("your error is in the coupling handoff at
  t ∈ [2.0, 2.5]"). `march_adaptive` doubles subcycles where the
  cocycle exceeds tolerance (cap 64). `activation_report` encodes the
  Proposal-4 SEQUENCING gate: splitting error under 20% of budget →
  INSTRUMENT-ONLY (measure it, don't control it). Slab constructors
  and marchers fail fast on zero substeps/slabs, invalid time spans,
  non-finite states/couplings, and non-positive total error budgets;
  ledger reporting rejects hand-built malformed entries before
  attribution or JSON emission.

- `hybrid` module (RE.Z1; `[M]` object semantics, no theorem promotion):
  `ZenoProblemIrV1` is the finite, versioned object language for a hybrid
  model and immutable model version, original-versus-regularized lineage,
  initial-state set, frame and unit conventions, physical time scale, finite
  modes and continuous ODE/inclusion/admitted-DAE dynamics, oriented guards,
  transverse/grazing/Unknown crossing state, deterministic/set-valued/
  terminal/Unknown reset relations, contact/relay laws, simultaneous-event
  groups and policy, dwell semantics, event language, hybrid-time domain,
  compactness, numerical accumulation candidates, continuation category, and
  semantic-analysis budget. All artifact roles use non-confusable typed IDs.
  Unsupported infinite-dimensional dynamics, zero DAE index, invalid time or
  budget data, missing mode references, malformed simultaneous priorities,
  and self-referential regularization refuse.
- `validate_zeno_problem_v1(ir, cx)` caps modes/events before any nested reset
  scan, then aggregates bounded reset-target counts with permutation-stable
  diagnostics before sorting or graph work. It polls cancellation at bounded
  strides, canonicalizes set order, and mints a domain-separated
  `ZenoProblemIdV1` plus independent canonical-preimage receipt only on
  success. Its conservative finite graph analysis records zero/Unknown-dwell
  cycles and local nonuniqueness. A unique
  continuation category refuses when differential inclusions, grazing or
  unresolved guards, set-valued or unresolved resets, unresolved simultaneous
  ordering make it an overclaim. A zero-time cycle is recorded separately: it
  enables an accumulation question but does not by itself select a unique or
  nonunique post-Zeno rule.
- `ZenoClassificationV1` keeps five states disjoint: positive finite-event
  separation, theorem-shaped certified-Zeno descriptor, numerical
  event-density warning, a distinct regularized-model lineage, and Unknown.
  `PostZenoStateV1` independently records not-applicable, unique, set-valued,
  terminal, or unresolved post-accumulation semantics.
  `validate_zeno_claim_descriptor_v1` cross-checks the exact problem and
  continuation category. Event caps and numerical-only traces cannot enter a
  theorem-shaped classification; finite separation requires a positive dwell
  bound on every admitted event; certified Zeno requires a zero/Unknown-dwell
  accumulation cycle in this finite automaton; regularized claims require the exact second
  validated problem and matching source lineage. Claim and post-state choices
  participate in `ZenoClaimIdV1`.
- A successful `ValidatedZenoClaimDescriptorV1` always returns
  `ScientificCorrectnessNotProven`. Opaque analytic/interval witness IDs are
  replay references, not authority tokens. RE.Z2 must independently check and
  promote a descriptor before any Zeno, finite-separation, or continuation
  theorem exists.

## Invariants

- Verlet is symplectic ⇒ **bounded** (non-secular) energy error;
  its KDK positions satisfy the discrete Euler–Lagrange recurrence
  q_{k+1} = 2q_k − q_{k−1} + h²F(q_k) (Marsden–West).
- Exp-map attitude updates keep ‖q‖ = 1 by construction — no
  renormalization anywhere in the crate.
- Generalized-α: high-frequency per-step contraction → ρ∞; order 2
  across the whole ρ∞ range.
- Dense and operator-backed generalized-α/IMEX paths use the same parameter
  formulas, intermediate-time convention, correctors, and ARS weights.
  Equality across those arithmetic paths is to the declared nonlinear/Krylov
  tolerance; it is not claimed bitwise.
- Implicit operator steps are transaction-like: a failed nonlinear or shifted
  linear solve leaves the public trajectory state unchanged. Every accepted
  step appends exactly one telemetry row before returning.
- `AdaptiveState` is COMPLETE: checkpoint = `clone()`; split runs are
  **bitwise-equal** to straight runs, controller memory (`err_prev`)
  and counters included (P7). A step shortened to land exactly on
  t_end does not feed the controller (the clamped h would poison the
  h carried into a later resumed segment).
- Hybrid identities are invariant to input ordering of mode/event sets and
  sensitive to every model version, initial set, frame/unit/time convention,
  guard/reset/law, event order, regularization, budget, claim, and no-claim
  artifact. An execution event cap is byte-visible policy, never proof.

## Error model

Construction panics with a structured message when a required
factorization is singular (`GeneralizedAlpha::new`,
`FirstOrderGeneralizedAlpha::new`, `Imex2::new`):
these are modeling errors (h incompatible with the operators), not
runtime conditions. Operator-backed methods return typed dimension,
non-finite explicit-stage, Newton-setup, and not-converged refusals; their
reports retain the exhausted budget or breakdown diagnosis. `verlet_adjoint`
inherits `fs_ad::revolve`'s budget assertion. Legacy dense steppers themselves
are panic-free on finite input; NaN/Inf propagate as NaN/Inf
(garbage-in, garbage-out, never UB).

## Determinism class

Bit-deterministic across ISAs BY CONSTRUCTION: no platform libm in any
solver path (workspace law) — transcendentals go through
`fs_math::det` (`sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `exp`, `expm1`, `pow`), including
the PI controller's `pow`, because the adaptive step SEQUENCE is part
of the contract. Test-side oracles may use std (disjoint-path rule).
Golden FNV-64 over Verlet, rigid-body, generalized-α, IMEX, ExpEuler
and RK45 trajectories (controller state and counters included):
`0xeae8_ccec_5e2e_cf41`, recorded on Apple M4 Pro (aarch64), verified
identical on Threadripper (x86_64). The operator-backed paths use
`fs-solver`'s deterministic reductions and logical-iteration preconditioner
contract. Their dense-vs-operator and split-run fixtures are deterministic on
the exercised build; they do not yet add a retained cross-ISA golden.
Hybrid problem and claim identities use bounded `fs-blake3` canonical schemas.
Canonical sets sort by typed identity, ordered priorities remain ordered, and
signed zero is normalized before hashing. Identical admitted input and schema
version replay byte-for-byte on every ISA; no numerical trajectory participates
in identity unless named by its exact trace ID.

## Cancellation behavior

All entry points are synchronous and run to completion for one bounded step.
Operator generalized-alpha bounds work by the configured Newton outer and
FGMRES cycle/restart budgets; operator IMEX bounds each stage by its configured
FGMRES budget. Long trajectories are resumable by cloning `SecondOrderState`,
`FirstOrderState`, `ImexState`, or `AdaptiveState` between calls; split runs
continue bitwise when the same operators, forcing, preconditioner policy, and
configuration are supplied. Hybrid problem validation polls `Cx` before work,
every 32 modes/events, during zero-time graph analysis, and inside canonical
identity streaming; cancellation publishes no token. No async, no internal
threading, no I/O.

## Unsafe boundary

None. `unsafe_code = "deny"` via workspace lints; no capsules.

## Feature flags

- `time-slabs` — [F] time slabs as temporal cells and splitting-error
  ledger/controller instrumentation. No optional dependencies.

## Conformance tests

energy boundedness vs RK4's secular decay at the same h + e = 0.6
Kepler orbit (~16 revolutions); discrete Euler–Lagrange residual

10⁵ steps with no renormalization; gyroscope battery (ω₃ constant to
1e−9, analytic precession phase Ω = (I₃−I₁)/I₁·ω₃ to 1e−3, energy and
spatial angular momentum to O(h²)); generalized-α spectral radius → ρ∞
at ωh = 10³ to 2% with ρ∞ = 0 annihilation and ρ∞ = 1 energy

`tests/galpha_probe.rs`: order-2 sweep across ρ∞ ∈ {0, .3, .5, .8, 1}
at two horizons — kept from the probe that diagnosed the period-point
metric blindness (at t = 2π, cos′ = 0: a q-only error measures phase
error quadratically and fakes order ≈ 4; the honest metric is
max(q, v) error).
`tests/operator_integrators.rs` (bead ra2q; G1/G3, JSON-line measurements):
second-order structural convergence on prefactored dense and diagonal
matrix-free `LinearOp`
paths; dense/operator structural agreement plus bitwise split replay with
Newton/Krylov telemetry; first-order-system order and dense/operator
agreement plus bitwise split replay; nonlinear first-order self-convergence;
and ARS(2,2,2)

budget-pie localization, adaptive-vs-uniform cost, G3 repartition
envelope, activation gate, and fail-fast validation for invalid slab
counts/substeps/tolerances/budgets, malformed public ledger entries,
and non-finite couplings.
`tests/se3.rs` (bead 3ol0, printed measurements on every gate):
SO(3)-lane agreement for pure rotations (se3-001); constant-twist
one-parameter composition exactness (se3-002); double-cover
canonicalization determinism, `M`/`−M` bit-equality, and bitwise
replay across a scalar-zero crossing (se3-003); free-body DEP spatial
momentum to roundoff plus bounded energy over 10⁴ steps with the
theorem claim class earned (se3-004); adjoint-vs-central-FD gate on
the DEP momentum map, four directions, rel ≤ 1e−6 (se3-005); the
honesty fixture — a damped run demotes to `MeasuredOnly` with nonzero
measured drift despite converged solves (se3-006); 10⁵-step
renormalization receipts bounding the final unit defect (se3-007);
SE(3) rigid-body agreement with the SO(3) lane and spatial
free-velocity drift at the measured-order level (se3-008).
`tests/hybrid.rs` (RE.Z1; G0/G3/G4/G5): relay-chatter and positive-dwell
microcases; mode/event input-order and schema replay; model-version identity

separation versus zero/Unknown-dwell cycles; simultaneous guards, grazing, and
set-valued-reset uniqueness refusals; exact regularization lineage; numerical
warning post-state honesty; unknown-mode, zero-index DAE, out-of-domain window,
unsupported-version, resource-cap, and pre-cancellation refusals.
Resource-cap coverage includes top-level mode/event/priority fail-fast behavior
before nested reset inspection, plus permutation-stable diagnostics for both
per-relation and aggregate reset-target caps.

## No-claim boundaries

- SE(3) motor states ship the exp-map lane and the FREE-BODY
  variational lane only: no forced/damped/constrained variational
  steps here (constrained lanes are fs-mbd's, through
  `RattleProjection`); the backward-error/modified-energy THEOREM is
  claimed only for the declared smooth conservative fixed-step class
  with converged solves — impacts, adaptivity, and dissipation get
  measured `BalanceReceipt`s, never the theorem. The
  `dep_momentum_adjoint` residual Jacobians are central differences of
  the actual residual (3×3), not analytic tangents; the analytic
  derivation and revolve checkpointing (O(N) memory today) are
  follow-up work. The variational lane's group update solves the
  midpoint transported-momentum fixed point; no claim of equivalence
  to any OTHER published DEP variant. No higher-order compositions
  (Yoshida/Suzuki), no splitting beyond kick–drift–kick.
- No Krylov φ-actions for large nonsymmetric A (needs Arnoldi);
  `ExpEuler` is dense-symmetric only. No Rosenbrock/SDIRK families,
  no BDF/multistep.
- No dense output / continuous extension for RK45; no stiffness
  detection; no event location.
- Adjoints ship for Verlet only (the template); generalized-α/IMEX/
  RK45 adjoints are the fs-ad integration lane (o3ui).
- Operator-backed generalized-alpha and IMEX remove the dense storage/API
  ceiling, but no roofline or field-scale iteration-count claim is made.
  `OperatorGeneralizedAlpha` currently inherits `NewtonKrylovState`'s identity
  inner preconditioner; an injected nonlinear-preconditioner seam is pending
  in the shared solver. `OperatorImex2` does accept an injected flexible
  preconditioner. Dense-vs-operator agreement is tolerance-based, not a claim
  that LU and Krylov execute identical floating-point reductions.
- Public trajectory checkpoints are accepted-step boundaries. Although the
  shared Newton/FGMRES engines are internally resumable, this fs-time API does
  not yet expose a mid-Newton or mid-IMEX-stage checkpoint artifact.
- First-order generalized-alpha requires the caller's initial `rate` to be
  consistent with its modeled residual and the supplied forcing. The crate
  records but does not independently certify that model consistency. The
  nonlinear `SecondOrderProblem`/`FirstOrderProblem` implementer likewise owns
  tangent consistency; this lane does not yet run an automatic JVP audit.
- RE.Z1 validates only finite hybrid object semantics and content identity. It
  does not locate events, enclose accumulation times, prove transversality,
  prove compactness, establish finite separation, certify Zeno behavior, or
  choose physically correct post-Zeno dynamics. `CertifiedZeno`, analytic, and
  interval-validated are descriptor labels bound to opaque evidence references;
  every returned descriptor says `ScientificCorrectnessNotProven` until the
  independent RE.Z2 checker promotes it. A compliant/penalty regularization is
  a distinct model with an explicit no-equivalence artifact, never evidence
  about the discontinuous source model.

## No-claim boundaries (slabs)

- Visibility and control of SPLITTING error only — NO claim of
  coupling STABILITY: added-mass FSI instabilities and stiff
  time-scale pathologies are per-coupling analysis problems (the
  proposal's own honest scope, verbatim).
- The monolithic reference is a fine RK4 over the slab — a numerical
  reference, not an exact solution; defects below its own error floor
  are not resolvable.
- The fixture family is the linear two-field testbed; PDE couplings
  ride fs-couple's port-Hamiltonian interconnection when both land.
- Parallel-in-time coarse propagators (the BDDC-pattern extension) are
  explicitly deferred.
