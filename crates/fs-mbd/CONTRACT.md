# CONTRACT: fs-mbd

## Purpose and layer

Layer: **L3 FLUX**. `fs-mbd` currently provides the safe-Rust foundation for
one smooth, unconstrained rigid body whose reference point is its centre of
mass. It is intentionally a bounded dependency-free core: validated diagonal
principal inertia, body-to-world orientation, momentum-form state, point
kinematics, atomic load/impulse events, uniform gravity, a constant external
wrench, diagnostics, and a deterministic fixed-step update.

This is a foundation for later rigid multibody work. It does not substitute for
the blocked contact, joint, constraint, nonlinear-solver, or nonholonomic
lanes.

## Public types and semantics

- `Vec3` is a small Cartesian vector. Every public field that carries a vector
  names its frame in the field name or documentation.
- `UnitQuaternion` is a normalized body-to-world quaternion. Construction uses
  scaled normalization, so finite huge and subnormal components do not overflow
  or underflow the normalization intermediate; it rejects only zero/non-finite
  input. The representative has the first nonzero component of `(w, x, y, z)`
  positive, making the double cover deterministic.
- `Pose::new` combines a finite world-space centre-of-mass position with that
  orientation. Its fields are private; `position_world()` and `orientation()`
  expose copies of the validated values.
- `MassProperties::new(mass, center_of_mass_body, principal_inertia_body)`
  accepts finite positive mass and principal moments satisfying the rigid-body
  triangle inequalities. The centre of mass must be exactly zero in the
  principal frame; offset-reference spatial inertia is refused.
- `RigidBodyState` stores world-frame linear momentum and body-frame angular
  momentum. Its fields are private and exposed through frame-named getters; it
  has no independent velocity or angular-velocity state.
- `Pose::point_world_from_body` and `Pose::point_body_from_world` are checked
  centre-of-mass-relative point transforms. `UnitQuaternion` provides the
  corresponding canonical world-to-body vector transform.
- `RigidBodyState::point_kinematics` returns a validated `PointKinematics`
  record with the body/world contact arm, point position, centre-of-mass
  velocity, angular velocity, and material-point velocity
  `v_com + omega_world cross r_world`.
- `RigidBodyState::directional_effective_mass` returns a normalized-direction
  `DirectionalEffectiveMass`. It is the unconstrained scalar free-body response
  at the declared body point; zero/non-finite directions and non-positive or
  non-finite derived denominators refuse.
- `RigidBodyState::apply_impulse_at_body_point` applies one world-frame impulse
  at a centre-of-mass-relative body arm. It updates `p_world += J_world` and
  `L_body += r_body cross J_body` without moving the pose, and returns a full
  `ImpulseReceipt` with before/after point kinematics and kinetic/work
  diagnostics. `apply_force_at_body_point` explicitly converts a finite force
  held for a positive declared duration into that same atomic momentum event;
  it intentionally does not pretend to integrate pose evolution during the
  duration.
- `apply_equal_and_opposite_impulse_at_body_points` returns two atomic event
  receipts plus algebraic impulse balance, floating-point linear-momentum
  change, and paired kinetic/work accounting. It does not infer that the two
  declared points coincide or constitute a physical contact.
- `Wrench` carries a constant world-frame force and principal-body-frame torque
  for one step. `Gravity` is a validated uniform world-frame acceleration with
  a private field and `acceleration_world()` getter.
- `RigidBodyIntegrator::step` returns a `StepReceipt` with the before/after
  states and diagnostics. Translation uses the midpoint linear momentum under
  the constant total force. Body angular momentum uses midpoint RK2 for
  `Ldot = L × I⁻¹L + tau`; attitude uses the body midpoint angular velocity in
  a right-composed quaternion exponential update.
- `RigidBodyIntegrator::diagnostics` returns
  `Result<DynamicsDiagnostics, DynamicsError>`. It revalidates its state,
  gravity, and mass properties and refuses non-finite derived energies or world
  angular momentum rather than publishing an `inf`/`NaN` ledger.
- `RigidBodyIntegrator::advance` invokes its cancellation callback before each
  whole step. It returns `AdvanceOutcome::Cancelled` with the last fully
  committed state and diagnostics when cancellation is observed.

## Invariants

- Public construction rejects non-finite mass-property, state, gravity, wrench,
  duration, and quaternion inputs at the relevant boundary. State, pose, and
  gravity fields cannot be forged externally; public integrator operations also
  revalidate their inputs before producing a receipt or diagnostic.
- The public orientation remains normalized and uses a canonical quaternion
  sign after every successful attitude update.
- The declared force and gravity are world-frame quantities; the declared
  torque and angular momentum are principal-body-frame quantities. Diagnostics
  rotate the latter to world space before adding orbital angular momentum.
- Each successful `step` constructs and returns a complete new state. In
  `advance`, only complete preceding steps are committed when cancellation is
  observed.
- Point kinematics, effective-mass queries, and event receipts validate all
  state, mass-property, arm, direction, force, impulse, and derived finite
  values before returning. The event APIs consume state by value and return a
  new state only inside a complete receipt, so a refusal leaves externally held
  state unchanged.

## Error model

`DynamicsError` is the refusal channel for non-finite input or derived result,
unrepresentable finite magnitude, invalid mass, invalid or physically
inconsistent principal inertia, invalid orientation, invalid directional
effective mass, unsupported non-centre-of-mass reference point, and invalid
duration. There are no panics in production paths for those invalid inputs.
Arithmetic overflow or a non-finite attitude update, kinematic transform,
effective-mass query, or impulse-work result is returned through the checked
boundary; already completed earlier steps of `advance` remain committed.

## Determinism class

The step order, frame transformations, quaternion sign convention, and
cancellation boundary are deterministic functions of the admitted inputs. The
implementation currently uses the Rust standard library's floating-point
`sqrt`, `sin`, and `cos`; therefore this contract makes no cross-ISA bitwise
claim and retains no cross-ISA evidence. Same-platform repeatability is an
implementation property to be exercised by consumers, not a retained G5
promotion from this eleven-test foundation.

## Cancellation behavior

This crate is synchronous and creates no threads, tasks, or I/O. `advance`
checks a caller-supplied cancellation predicate immediately before every
candidate step. A cancelled iteration does not start that step, so it cannot
partially change position, momentum, orientation, or its diagnostic result.
There is no `Cx` integration, deadline budget, allocation budget, drain phase,
or asynchronous cancellation protocol in this initial core.

## Unsafe boundary

None. The crate denies unsafe code and contains no unsafe blocks.

## Feature flags and dependencies

None. This initial core depends only on `std`/`core` and has no feature flags.

## Focused evidence

The inline test module in `src/lib.rs` contains seventeen focused checks:

1. mass, inertia, and centre-of-mass-reference refusals;
2. canonical quaternion double-cover selection and a known 180-degree rotation;
3. right-handed 90-degree z rotation plus nontrivial quaternion composition;
4. scaled normalization for finite huge/subnormal quaternion, axis, and
   rotation-vector inputs;
5. analytic constant-gravity translation plus energy conservation;
6. constant force/torque updates in their declared frames;
7. torque-free spherical-body energy and world angular-momentum conservation;
8. axisymmetric Euler-top phase sign and refinement toward its analytic body
   angular-velocity solution;
9. refinement reducing the measured energy defect for an asymmetric free body;
10. cancellation before a whole step, preserving the last completed state;
11. refusal of overflowing diagnostics, including an already-cancelled advance,
    without a false successful diagnostic receipt.
12. body/world point-arm transforms and `v_com + omega cross r` kinematics;
13. a rotated-arm impulse oracle for both linear and angular momentum plus its
    midpoint kinetic-work identity;
14. force-duration conversion matching the same declared impulse event;
15. a closed-form offset directional-effective-mass oracle and zero-direction
    refusal;
16. equal-and-opposite two-body impulse balance and paired work ledger;
17. non-finite and overflowing event-input refusal without a partial state.

These are local G0-style checks. They do not constitute full multibody,
constraint, contact, physical-validation, performance, G4 fault-injection, or
G5 cross-ISA evidence.

## No-claim boundaries

- No contacts, impacts, friction, complementarity, penetration handling, or
  static-friction capacity are represented.
- No joints, holonomic constraints, nonholonomic rolling constraints, RATTLE
  projection, generalized-alpha lane, Newton/Krylov solve, or constraint
  impulse/defect receipt is present.
- No full 6x6 spatial inertia, non-principal inertia tensor, offset reference
  point, material receipt, geometry-derived inertia assembly, flexible body,
  articulated multibody graph, or Euler-disc-specific rule is present. The
  point/impulse API is deliberately parameterized only by the existing checked
  diagonal principal inertia and is an extension point, not a claim that a
  general symmetric or spatial inertia has been implemented.
- No collision detection, signed gap, support mapping, common-point proof,
  contact selection, impact/restitution law, complementarity solve, friction
  cone, or no-slip constraint is implemented. An equal-and-opposite impulse is
  algebraic action/reaction only; it does not by itself establish angular-
  momentum conservation about a shared contact point or physical admissibility.
- The midpoint update is not claimed symplectic, variational, energy exactly
  conserving, momentum exactly conserving for arbitrary inertia, adaptive,
  adjoint-capable, or physically validated.
- Diagnostics describe the simulated smooth state; they do not mint a
  certificate, authority, or release-level conservation claim.
