# fs-gas contract

`fs-gas` owns L3 evolving gas systems. Constitutive and species laws remain in
`fs-thermochem`; this crate does not replace those sources with an independent
caloric model. Production dependencies remain pure Rust and Franken-owned.

## Experimental frozen-composition Euler flow

Feature `experimental-euler` exposes `dynamics::{FrozenGas, Euler1d}`. It is an
Estimated engineering baseline for one-dimensional, inviscid, fixed-area flow
of a single frozen ideal-gas mixture. It advances actual compressible waves,
contacts, shocks and rarefactions without the low-Mach lattice assumption.
It does not grant the separate entropy/invariant-domain lane's theorem claim.
This implements the first transport slice of
`frankensim-ext-gas-1d-network-vvnx`; that broad network bead remains open.

### Source and thermodynamic state

The immutable `FrozenGas` owns the complete original NASA-9 mixture and a
caller-declared temperature interval. All active species must support that
interval without gaps. Crossing source regions requires the original source's
explicit caloric-continuity construction. Bounded directed-rounding interval
subdivision of each component's original Cv/R polynomial admits positive Cv
over the whole path. Failure to establish that bound refuses construction.
The subdivision uses a fixed-size stack and at most 4095 work items per region.

Pressure is `rho R T`; frozen sound speed is `sqrt((Cp/Cv) R T)` at the same
temperature and composition. Temperature inversion uses the original source's
reference-invariant internal-energy difference and analytic Cv, with safeguarded
Newton/bisection and explicit absolute/relative energy tolerances and iteration
limits. There is no constant-gamma substitution for a variable-Cp source.
Full source-bearing evaluations remain available through `thermodynamics`.

Conserved cells contain mass density [kg/m³], axial momentum density
[kg/(m² s)] and referenced total-energy density [J/m³]. The energy variable is

`rho * (e(T) - e(Tmin) + u²/2)`.

The original signed `e(Tmin)` remains in the owner. Physical total energy is
recovered by adding `e(Tmin)*rho`, and physical energy flux by adding the same
reference times mass flux. This exact linear change of conservative variables
avoids rounding away sensible energy under large formation references. It is
valid for the declared frozen composition and cannot silently transfer to a
reacting or composition-changing cell. No positivity requirement is imposed on
the original absolute formation/internal energy.

### Conservative transport and boundaries

The numerical flux is HLLC using both states' actual frozen acoustic speeds.
Contact intermediate states must have positive density/pressure and internal
energy inside the admitted source interval. Degenerate or inadmissible contact
states use an HLL fallback; its intermediate state is checked, with bounded
wave-speed expansion if required. These local checks are not a proof of global
entropy stability or positivity for arbitrary EOS data.

MUSCL uses monotonized-central primitive slopes, reduced together when needed
to retain positive density/pressure and the declared source interval. SSP RK2
uses one shared oriented flux per face. Periodic end faces share the same flux
bits; reflecting stationary walls impose exact zero mass and energy flux;
transmissive boundaries use zero-gradient ghost states and are not claimed to
be nonreflecting subsonic outlets.

Every stage checks its actual face-speed CFL against the caller's value, at most
0.45. Failed trials halve dt within an explicit retry cap. CFL-only retries
retain the requested spatial reconstruction; actual admissibility failures use
a first-order retry. Every accepted stage and final cell must remain in the
source domain. No conservative variable, temperature or pressure is clipped.
`StepReport` retains the actual time increment, maximum stage CFL, fallback
counts and extensive mass/momentum/energy balances against the two RK stages'
integrated boundary fluxes.

Workspace is allocated once, with a hard cap of 1,048,576 cells and fallible
allocation. Successful steps allocate no numerical workspace. Cancellation is
polled through cells, faces, source admission, inversion and retries. A refusal
or cancellation preserves the complete original cell field and time. Operations
are ordered deterministically on one arithmetic target; cross-ISA bit identity
and parallel scaling have not been measured.

### Focused native evidence

Eight tests of the complete source compiled and executed through the actual
pure thermochemistry dependency closure. They cover source-gauge invariance
under ±1e18 formation offsets, variable-Cv/high-speed EOS round trips, HLLC
stationary contacts, uniform state and reflecting-wall conservation, strong
rarefaction positivity, source-domain refusal and early/mid/late cancellation.

Measured regression results on the authored fixtures:

| Case | Resolution | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smooth contact advection, density L1 | 40 / 80 / 160 cells | 7.98344e-4 / 1.96127e-4 / 4.72099e-5 |
| Sod tube, independent exact gamma-law oracle, density L1 | 120 / 240 cells | 4.01893e-3 / 2.20519e-3 |
| Lax tube, same independent oracle, density L1 | 120 / 240 cells | 1.48205e-2 / 9.28277e-3 |
| Variable-Cp acoustic wave | 128 cells | Measured speed 1.15993219 vs source speed 1.15966702 m/s |

The independent oracle uses shock Hugoniot and rarefaction-invariant relations,
not production HLLC/source-inversion code. A nonlinear variable-Cp shock also
executes with conserved boundary accounting. These are manufactured/conformance
tests, not experimental validation or a performance benchmark.

`cargo run -p fs-gas --features experimental-euler --example shock_tube -- 240`
runs a one-metre N2 tube with the 200–1000 K NASA-9 coefficient region already
retained in the thermochemistry fixtures, and emits the resulting field as CSV.
The native run advanced 292 steps to 4.739365351855e-4 s, with zero reported mass
balance residual and -7.68e-15 J referenced-energy balance residual. The material
association is explicitly declared by the example; this is not a validated
nitrogen shock-tube experiment.

### Scope boundary

No evolving species transport, chemistry/flow splitting, area variation,
junctions, valves, viscous stresses, heat conduction, moving mesh, vacuum state,
real-gas EOS, multidimensional flow, adjoint, entropy certificate or experimental
validation is supplied by this Euler slice. A source-domain refusal is an actual
refusal and does not extend a NASA fit to hotter or colder shocked gas.
